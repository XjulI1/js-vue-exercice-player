# exercice-tech-vuejs-player

## Instructions

Thanks to the LoopBack server present in `/server` and the VueJS project present in` /src`, you need to create a web page that includes a video player, create from the `shaka-player` library (already installed), to be able to read the MP4 stream which is present in the return of the API call `http: // localhost: 3000 / player`.

This page should also include:

- The title of the program
- The description of the program
- The cover of the program

For the visual rendering of the page, we give free rein to your imagination.

The exercise should be returned with the submission of a pull request on this Github repo.

Good luck ðŸ˜€
